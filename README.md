Poor man's specular light shader for (Canvas)[https://github.com/grondag/canvas] renderer (a fabric minecraft).

As is common with minecraft shaders, it works with sun light only. Block light does nothing.

Applies to:
- Block of iron
- Block of gold
- Block of diamond
- Block of emerald
- Block of netherite

But more can be added to the material maps as desired.

## Why?

Proper PBR support for Canvas is planned. This shader is for impatient people.

This shader is made to work on Canvas 1.0.1081-snapshot and possibly the next immediate unstable release following it.

When new features are added to Canvas, this shader may be rendered obsolete.
